StoPlay Chrome Extension
===========

Google Chrome extension to stop/play music playing in your web-browser via
popular streaming services.

**These are source files, for actual working extension please visit
[Chrome webstore](http://bit.ly/stoplay).**


At the moment we fully support (stop and play)
* vkontakte
* Grooveshark
* vimeo
* YouTube
* Rutube
* TED.com
* FS.to (brb.to)
* Muzebra
* Pleer.com
* Last.fm (web-version)

## How it works
It just works!

The extension automatically pauses your previous playing media when you open
a new one (in case if supported, of course).

Also you can click the pause bar button to stop it.

## Purpose
We just needed this feature in the browser.
When you listen to music online with different services, at times it can be
difficult to find the needed tab and then the **pause** button there.
It also very cool when you open another video and music stops automatically for
you to watch the video.

## Contributing
We understand that there are tons of other streaming services, that's why we are
eager to share the stuff with everybody to enable this feature for the
service of your choice.

So fork it right over, add your service support, make pull request and we will
try to include it in the extension as soon as possible.
