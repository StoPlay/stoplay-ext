Everyone is welcome to participate.

We don't do regular releases, only when some bugfixes or new stuff is ready.



## (Git) flow
1. Create a branch with the name {feature or bugfix}/{issue ID}-{short description} (forked off **origin/develop**). E.g. feature/51-mubert for [#51 Add http://play.mubert.com/ support](../issues/51)
2. Commit your code, push the branch
3. Create a pull request (it will prompt you in a Github UI)
4. Wait some time until repo-team approves the pull-request.
